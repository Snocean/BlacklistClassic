Updating this addon to work with the new version of wow classic

Currently the entire addon seems to work as it was originally created with the exception of visual issues due to changes in how the wow client handles the UI

Fixed background for the main details and options pane, fixed displays for information within the details panel, updated spacing to be more balanced, modified and moved close button slightly
